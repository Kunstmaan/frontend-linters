# Kunstmaan TSLint

## TypeScript Rules

For TypeScript we extend the [AirBnB styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some exceptions.

Basically, we use the same ruleset as we do for JavaScript, Start off by reading the AirBnB styleguide, and [our JavaScript rules](../eslint-config). There are no specific gotcha's for TypeScript, for now...

## React-specific Rules

For our React rules we also extend the Palantir's [TSLint React Preset](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react), and supplement this with exceptions and overwrites to get the same result as we do in our ESLint config.
